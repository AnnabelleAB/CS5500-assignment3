As we are working with the calc-sheet, we are finding more things we would like to update/fix.  For example, in addition to the locking mentioned above, teams have reported the following concerns:

User closes tab while editing cell
User changes username while editing cell
Overly long usernames or formulas overflow cell
Newlines are allowed in user names
Certain symbols in usernames can allow text to escape onto the page
and you will find more!!!

Make sure your team is keeping track of these kinds of issues in a project backlog.  Write up three of these bugs (and/or others you find!) in a user story format:

As a user i expect <state behaviour> 
Issue with system based on the stated user story
Repo steps:  How do i repo the issue.  (What are the steps that i need to do to reproduce this issue)
For example: 
There was a bug that is now fixed where a user could edit a cell that did not belong to them.
Repo step: To reproduce the C bug (which is now fixed) you go to a cell that you are not editing and you click on C
